Here's a breakdown of what each part of the code does:

The HTML code begins with the <html> tag, which indicates that this is an HTML document. The code between the <html> and </html> tags is the entire content of the page.

Inside the HTML tags, there is a <style> tag. The CSS styles are defined between <style> and </style>. This section defines styles for the div element with id my_box.

The CSS code sets the position of the div to absolute. Which will position the div in relation to the nearest positioned ancestor instead of the viewport, but if none is found it will be positioned relative to the initial containing block.

In this case, bottom and right positions are set to 0px which means div will be positioned in the right bottom corner of the screen

CSS also sets a minimum width and height of the div to 100px.

Lastly, it sets the background color of the div to red.

The <script> tag contains JavaScript code. In this example, the JavaScript section is left empty, so the script doesn't perform any actions.

The body of the HTML document contains a single <div> tag with the id "my_box". This is where the red box will be displayed on the web page.

The </body> and </html> tags indicate the end of the HTML code, and closes the HTML page.

In summary, this code creates a red box with a minimum width and height of 100px that will be located at the right bottom corner of the screen using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

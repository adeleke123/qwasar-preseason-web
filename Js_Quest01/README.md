# Introduction

Studies show that the best way to learn is through immersion.

Starting now, we will consider you a Junior Web developer. Congratulations! :-)

Time to work!

We will start our first job to get familiar with `web technologies`. HTML!

Before we begin, let's refresh our memory about web servers. In order to access a webpage, we need to have a web server to `serve` it.

This means for our following assignment we will need a web server too. Luckily we have one, follow the instructions from `Static Html Page Renderer Section`.

This is exciting, let's do some html / css / and javascript! :)

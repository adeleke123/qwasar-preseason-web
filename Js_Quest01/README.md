# Introduction

Studies show that the best way to learn is through immersion.

Starting now, we will consider you a Junior Web developer. Congratulations! :-)

Time to work!

We will start our first job to get familiar with `web technologies`. HTML!

Before we begin, let's refresh our memory about web servers. In order to access a webpage, we need to have a web server to `serve` it.

This means for our following assignment we will need a web server too. Luckily we have one, follow the instructions from `Static Html Page Renderer Section`.

This is exciting, let's do some html / css / and javascript! :)

## Description

Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <img /> and <input /> directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <p> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.

You will need to
Create an index.html file with a h1 tag saying "Hello World".

To display your page you will need a `static html page renderer` (see annex at the bottom).

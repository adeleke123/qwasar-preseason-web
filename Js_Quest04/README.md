## Introduction
From Hollywood's movies:
"Give me a pdf, so I will connect my ssh to my RSA and I will be able to access the md5."

Most computers on earth are not running any Graphical User Interface (GUI) and the closest thing we have to it is the terminal.

But more importantly, you can do more things with the terminal than with the GUI.
We will take some time to write some scripts.

At the end of the bootcamp you will be one of us :-)

The syntax is only a small part of what you need to learn to write quality code.

In order to "organize" your code, functions are the key. Let's dive in to functions!

(The XX is what you need to replace)

Function prototype (javascript)

// Following XXXXXX will be a function that will print using console.log("my_first_function")

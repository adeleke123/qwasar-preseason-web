## Js Quest04

Remember to git add && git commit && git push each exercise!

We will execute your function with our test(s), please DO NOT PROVIDE ANY TEST(S) in your file

For each exercise, you will have to create a folder and in this folder, you will have additional files that contain your work. Folder names are provided at the beginning of each exercise under `submit directory` and specific file names for each exercise are also provided at the beginning of each exercise under `submit file(s)`.

## Introduction
From Hollywood's movies:
"Give me a pdf, so I will connect my ssh to my RSA and I will be able to access the md5."

Most computers on earth are not running any Graphical User Interface (GUI) and the closest thing we have to it is the terminal.

But more importantly, you can do more things with the terminal than with the GUI.
We will take some time to write some scripts.

At the end of the bootcamp you will be one of us :-)

## Description
The syntax is only a small part of what you need to learn to write quality code.
Software Architecture (Designing Software) is really the core part of each project and being a good engineer.

In order to "organize" your code, functions are the key. Let's dive in to functions!

Replace/Complete the following code.
(The XX is what you need to replace)

Function prototype (javascript)
```
// Following XXXXXX will be a function that will print using console.log("my_first_function")
XXXXXX
XXXXXX
XXXXXX

my_first_function();
```
Example 00
```
Input: 
Output: my_first_function

Return Value: nil
```

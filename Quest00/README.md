# Introduction

Welcome to the `Shell environment` quest.
We will dive into the environment of the famous command box. It's the Command center of the computer, very powerful but might be a little confusing at first sight.
In this quest, you will learn how to create directories and files with the right permissions, to read the listing directory command and to git push all your exercises.
You will also use the archive command `tar` and you will finish by writing your first script. If we compare this with learning how to play a sport, you must be able to stand up, walk and run before being able to play a sport. With this quest, you will learn how to stand up! :-)

**Ex00:**`My First File`

+ repo: `qwasar-preseason-web`
+ directory: `Quest00`
+ file: `my_first_file`

## Description

For this very first assignment, you will be asked to create a file called `my_first_file` in your directory.

Which directory?

It's specified above this sentence (Submit directory: ex00 ;-))

Each assignment follows the same structure, you have to create a directory, go to the directory (cd), and work on your assignment.

Proceed by creating a file with the command: `touch` as you've seen in the video.

To verify if everything is in order: `ls`

You should see the file `my_first_file`.

Tip
To test if your exercise(s) is/are correct(s), you can execute the command `gandalf` in your terminal.

**Ex01:**`My First File With Content`

+ repo: `qwasar-preseason-web`
+ directory: `Quest00`
+ file: `my_first_file_with_content`

## Description

Create a file called `my_first_file_with_content` in your directory. Update its size.

Size needs to be: `40`.

How can a file have a size of 40?

Each character (or letter) is 1, so you simply need to add 40 characters inside the file. ;-)

In order to print this information, use the command `ls -l` (command is ls and `-l` is one option).

**Example00**

```

$>ls -l
xxxxxxxxx  x xxxxx  xxxxx  40 May  25 14:30 my_first_file_with_content
$>

```
We've replaced some values with x, which means they are not important at the moment. You can disregard them :)

**Tips**

`$>` is a very common way to represent a `prompt`.

How to read the above `Example00`:

You are in a shell (the `$>`) and you've executed the command `ls -l`.

It has printed: `xxxxxxxxx  x xxxxx  xxxxx  40 May  25 14:30 my_first_file_with_content`

And the last line is reprinting the `prompt` (`$>`).

Tips

The terminal is the little box where you execute command at the bottom part of `Docode`.

To test if your exercise(s) is/are correct(s), you can execute the command `gandalf` in your terminal.

**Ex02:**`My First File With Content And Perms`

+ repo: `qwasar-preseason-web`
+ directory: `Quest00`
+ file: `my_first_file_with_content_and_perms`

## Description

**Part 00**

Create a file called my_first_file_with_content_and_perms in your directory. Update its size THEN its permissions. (It must be done in this order because you will be asked to remove the permission to WRITE to a file which will be problematic if you want to add content inside it. ;-))

Size needs to be: `40` (be creative, here, how a file can have a size of 40...? :))
Permissions need to be: `r--r-xr-x` (Google chmod? :-))
In order to print this information, use the command `ls -l` (command is `ls` and `-l` is one option).

**Example00**
```

$>ls -l
-r--r-xr-x  1 login  group  40 May  25 14:30 my_first_file_with_content_and_perms
$>

```
Tips

`$>` is a very common way to represent a `prompt`.

How to read the above `Example00`:

You are in a shell (the `$>`) and you've executed the command `ls -l`.
It has printed: `-r--r-xr-x  1 login  group  40 May  25 14:30 my_first_file_with_content_and_perms`
And the last line is reprinting the `prompt` (`$>`).

Tip

The terminal is the little box where you execute command at the bottom part of `Docode`.

**Part 01**

Once youâ€™ve finished the previous steps, execute the following
command to create the file that will be submitted:
```
tar -cf my_first_file_with_content_and_perms.tar my_first_file_with_content_and_perms

```

**Ex03:**`My Gitaddcommitpush`

+ repo: `qwasar-preseason-web`
+ directory: `Quest00`
+ file: `file`

##Description

Time to Git!

Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. @Wikipedia

0. Create a file with the word "content" as the actual content of the file (disturbing?!)
```
$>echo "content" > file

```
1. Add that file to the commit (feel free to Google what a commit is!)
```
$>git add file

```
2. Prepare the commit with a message (please find below an example of a commit message; you should provide an accurate message for each commit you will do during your software engineer's life)
```
$>git commit -m "I swear I will ALWAYS add a great message for my commits"

```
3. Push the commit
```
$>git push

```
4. Now we know you know how to use git. No excuses and ALWAYS PUSH YOUR WORK. :-)
(5. If you have any problem with gandalf, make sure the cursor is at a new line)

Extra:
0. git log

1. git status
2. git clone

**Ex04:**`My Z`

+ repo: `qwasar-preseason-web`
+ directory: `Quest00`
+ file: `my_z`

##Description

Create a file called `my_z` that returns "Z", followed by a new line, whenever the command `cat` is used on it.
```
$>cat my_z
Z
$>

```
"Z" Stands For Zorro. :-)

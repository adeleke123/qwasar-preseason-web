## Introduction

Welcome to the `Shell environment` quest.
We will dive into the environment of the famous command box. It's the Command center of the computer, very powerful but might be a little confusing at first sight.
In this quest, you will learn how to create directories and files with the right permissions, to read the listing directory command and to git push all your exercises.
You will also use the archive command `tar` and you will finish by writing your first script. If we compare this with learning how to play a sport, you must be able to stand up, walk and run before being able to play a sport. With this quest, you will learn how to stand up! :-)

Ex00:

+ repo: `Quest00`
+ file: `my_first_file`

# Description

For this very first assignment, you will be asked to create a file called `my_first_file` in your directory.

Which directory?

It's specified above this sentence (Submit directory: ex00 ;-))

Each assignment follows the same structure, you have to create a directory, go to the directory (cd), and work on your assignment.

Proceed by creating a file with the command: `touch` as you've seen in the video.

To verify if everything is in order: `ls`

You should see the file `my_first_file`.

Tip
To test if your exercise(s) is/are correct(s), you can execute the command `gandalf` in your terminal.

**Ex01:**

+ repo: `Quest00`
+ file: `my_first_file_with_content`

# Description

Create a file called `my_first_file_with_content` in your directory. Update its size.

Size needs to be: `40`.
How can a file have a size of 40?
Each character (or letter) is 1, so you simply need to add 40 characters inside the file. ;-)

In order to print this information, use the command `ls -l` (command is ls and `-l` is one option).

**Example00**

```

$>ls -l
xxxxxxxxx  x xxxxx  xxxxx  40 May  25 14:30 my_first_file_with_content
$>

```
We've replaced some values with x, which means they are not important at the moment. You can disregard them :)

**Tips**

`$>` is a very common way to represent a `prompt`.

How to read the above `Example00`:

You are in a shell (the `$>`) and you've executed the command `ls -l`.
It has printed: `xxxxxxxxx  x xxxxx  xxxxx  40 May  25 14:30 my_first_file_with_content`
And the last line is reprinting the `prompt` (`$>`).

Tips
The terminal is the little box where you execute command at the bottom part of `Docode`.
To test if your exercise(s) is/are correct(s), you can execute the command `gandalf` in your terminal.
